                The middlegame is all about manuvering and tactics. Use these tips to get an edge.

                        Rooks on open files are not blocked by their own pawns and can control more squares making their presence more felt on the board.

                        Bishops on the long diagonals can see all the way to the other end of the board, giving them control over more squares.

                    <p>
                        Pawns can only support each other side by side or diagonally. When left alone, or stacked in a column, they cannot help each other and are easily picked off.

                    <p>
                        The bishop pair can be more valuble than a knight and bishop or two knights because of their long range and ability to cover each others weaknesses. Each bishop controls it's own color complex and together they can make it difficult for opponents to manuver their pieces.

                    <p>
                        When the center is full of pawns and nothing can move or see to the other side, knights may still be able to manuver around due to their ability to hop over other pieces. Keep your knights in closed positions!

                    <p>
                        When opponents push too many pawns, they might leave spots where you can place knights and bishops deep in their territory that cannot be dislodged by their pawns. Exploit them and put your minor pieces where they can be strongest.

                    <p>
                        Bishops are stuck to one color, so if one is lost, the pawns must step up and control the other color complex. Place pawns on light squares to complement dark squared bishops and vice versa. Failing to do this can get your bishop blocked by its own pawns.
